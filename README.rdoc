#Provides an easy way to parse XML output from mysql -X.
#MySQLXML::parse takes an IO object for the XML and a block that gets called
#once for each record. The records are represented as hashes keyed by string
#representations of column names.
#
#Example:
#  MySQLXML::parse(File.new('test.xml')) do |record|
#    puts record['username']
#  end
#
#This uses REXML's stream parser, so it should be reasonably
#memory efficient.
